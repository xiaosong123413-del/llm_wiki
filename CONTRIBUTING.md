# Contributing to llmwiki

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This guide covers the fork-and-PR workflow we use for all contributions.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork** the repository on GitHub
2. **Clone** your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/llm-wiki-compiler.git
   cd llm-wiki-compiler
   ```
3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. **Create a feature branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/<your-feature-name>
   ```

## Branch Naming

- `feature/<name>` — new features
- `fix/<name>` — bug fixes

## Development

### Build and Test

```bash
npm run build    # Compile TypeScript
npm test         # Run all tests
npm run dev      # Watch mode for development
```

**Before submitting a PR, run all checks:**

```bash
npx tsc --noEmit   # Type-check
npm run build       # Build
npm test            # Tests
fallow              # Codebase health (dead code, duplication, complexity)
```

All tests must pass and fallow must report no issues. Use `fallow fix --yes` to auto-fix unused exports, then fix any remaining issues manually.

### Code Style

- Follow the conventions in `CLAUDE.md`
- **File size limit:** 400 lines (excluding comments). Refactor if exceeded.
- **Function size limit:** 40 lines (excluding comments and catch/finally blocks).
- Use TypeScript with proper types — avoid `any`.
- Include JSDoc comments on all exported functions and at the top of each file.
- Write meaningful variable and function names that reveal purpose.

### Writing Tests

- Place tests in the `test/` directory
- Use Vitest (already configured)
- Tests should not depend on timing or external services
- Keep test files under 400 lines; split if needed

## Submitting a Pull Request

1. Push your branch to your fork
2. Open a PR against `main` on this repository
3. In your PR description:
   - Describe **what** the change does and **why**
   - Reference the issue number if applicable (e.g., "Closes #3")
   - Include instructions on how to test the change
4. Ensure CI checks pass

## Review Process

- A maintainer will review your PR within a few days
- Address any requested changes by pushing new commits to your branch
- Once approved, the maintainer will squash-merge your PR
