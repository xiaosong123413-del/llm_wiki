/**
 * Semantic dependency tracking for cross-source concept sharing.
 *
 * When multiple source files contribute to the same concept, a change in one
 * source should trigger recompilation of that concept using content from ALL
 * contributing sources. This module builds a reverse index from concepts back
 * to their source files, then identifies which unchanged sources are affected
 * by changes to other sources that share concepts with them.
 *
 * Without this, if sources A and B both produce concept X and source A changes,
 * concept X would be regenerated using only source A's content — losing source
 * B's contribution entirely.
