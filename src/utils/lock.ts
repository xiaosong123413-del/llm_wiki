/**
 * PID-based lock file for preventing concurrent compilation.
 *
 * Fresh acquisition uses O_CREAT | O_EXCL (the 'wx' flag) for atomic lock
 * creation — the kernel guarantees only one process can create the file.
 *
 * Stale lock reclamation uses a two-lock protocol:
 * 1. Acquire a reclamation lock (.llmwiki/lock.reclaim) via 'wx' to serialize
 *    all processes attempting to reclaim the same stale main lock.
 * 2. Re-verify the main lock is still stale (another reclaimer may have
 *    already fixed it).
 * 3. unlink + tryCreateLock('wx') on the main lock — safe because we hold
 *    exclusive reclamation access.
 * 4. Release the reclamation lock in a finally block.
 *
 * The reclamation lock itself can become stale if a process crashes during
 * the brief reclamation window. When that happens, acquireReclaimLock only
 * cleans up the stale file — it does NOT retry acquisition in the same call.
 * This eliminates the unlink-then-create race that would allow two processes
 * to both hold the reclaim lock. The outer retry loop in acquireLock handles
 * convergence: first pass cleans up the stale reclaim lock, second pass
 * acquires it cleanly via 'wx'.
